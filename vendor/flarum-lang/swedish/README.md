# flarum-swe
A Swedish language extension for [Flarum](http://flarum.org/).

This extension is based on the excellent work by [@Taddis](https://github.com/taddis). Thank you for carrying the flag in translating Flarum, I´ll do my best to pick it up.

This extension only contains translations for [flarum/flarum](https://github.com/flarum/flarum).

## Information

## Installation
To install this extension start by running the following command in your Flarum root folder:

Lastly you can go to to the _Basics_ section and set the _Default Language_.

## Thanks
A big thanks to both [@acarlsson](https://github.com/acarlsson) who created [the first Swedish language extension](https://github.com/acarlsson/flarum-ext-swedish) for Flarum, a lot of the initial translations came from that project. And also a big thanks to [@nlssn](https://github.com/nlssn) who not only picked up after [@acarlsson](https://github.com/acarlsson) but also maintained it for quite some time. Again, thank you guys!
