![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg) [![Latest Stable Version](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/zerosonesfun/flarum-member.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/zerosonesfun/flarum-member)

A [Flarum](http://flarum.org) extension. Adds class for logged in members. If someone is logged in, "logged-in" is added as a CSS class to the `body` tag. This very simple extension will allow you to make endless CSS customizations just for members. (CSS knowledge required.)

Now includes two BBCodes:
`[members][/members]` - only logged in members see this content
`[guests][/guests]` - guests see this content but it will be hidden for logged in members

composer require zerosonesfun/flarum-member
